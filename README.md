<b>Crisis Management System</b>

For this school project, we are to come up with a Crisis Management System for the Ministry of Home Affairs to allow centralized control of government agency resources to be managed and deployed in times of emergency. Emergency events will populate a map of Singapore and they can be handled in real time.
